  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE OR APOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When one writes a book, a preface is in order.
Mine shall be by way of explanation. The only
apology I have to offer for writing this little personal
<a id='pronoun' name='pronoun'></a>pronoun “I” story is the very simple one
that it is true. It has been said that “we never
talk so well as when talking of ourselves.” Be that
as it may, in telling my own story, I can tell it only
in the first person. It is a story that is very dear
to me, probably much more so than it will ever be
to any one else. In writing it I have lived it all
over, and it has been so real to me that I have
seemed to be again within hospital walls, peopled
by those whom I have called up from the shadows
of the past. In fancy, my mother, whose name is
interwoven as a golden thread throughout the fabric
of the story, has been with me, and I have almost
felt the “touch of a vanished hand” and heard
the “sound of a voice that is still.” Page after
page has been written beneath her picture on the
wall, and as I have lifted my tear-blinded eyes with
yearning gaze to her sweet face, the brown eyes
have looked lovingly down upon me as though
smiling approval upon my work. Oh, that I had
undertaken it while she was yet with me!</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be questioned that I have written from
memory—or it may be a matter of surprise that I
have remembered so well. While my mother lived
this period in our lives was often talked of and its
memory kept green. My father, being ill in the
second story of the hospital, knew little or
nothing of the experiences I underwent at Corinth,
but was more familiar with what took place
at Jackson. Five or six letters written by my
mother to friends in the North have been carefully
preserved. They were mostly hurriedly written
and contain only brief allusions to our doings, but
from them I have gathered dates and hours of arrival
and departure, and by them my memory has
been refreshed on several points. But for the most
part I have been entirely dependent upon my own
memory. I have written only of scenes and events
that I remember best. Many of them are as clear to
me as the happenings of yesterday, while some half-faded
memories have struggled vainly for utterence
and have necessarily been forever consigned to oblivion.
There is a possibility that I may be mistaken
in a few of my statements, but it must be
remembered that it is a long and dusty bridge over
which I have traveled to reach and gather them up.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this is not a story of fiction, I have given
the names of all that I remember who were in any
way connected with it, in the hope that there are
yet some of the number living who will read my
little narrative and recognize their own part in it.
Should such be the case, my joy at hearing from
any or all of them could not be expressed. I have
written, that there might be a record of the facts,
that my sister and brothers might become familiar
with them, and because I love to dwell upon the
incidents of my “army life,” as I sometimes term
it. Lastly, I have written that it might be as a
memorial to my brave, courageous mother, who,
with her own hands, ministered so tenderly to the
sick and wounded with whom she was brought in
close contact. Whether this ever reaches the public
eye is a question. Should it be so fortunate, I
ask the public to read with kindly criticism, remembering
that it is the story of the child told in
the language of the adult.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_7 c007'>1862-1899. The line between the dates represents
a bridge as it were of thirty-seven planks,
and each plank a year. It takes but a single
stroke of the pen to make the little bridge of
ink representing the years; but can I measure the
smiles and tears, the joys and sorrows, that are
crowded into each year? Can I retrace my steps,
passing on the way the graves that have opened and
closed on some of earth’s best and dearest treasures,
and gather from the past a few memories that the
corroding cares of life and the ever onward-rushing
“flood of years” have not wholly obliterated from
my mind? I can but try, and in so doing I feel
constrained to cry out,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Backward, turn backward, O, time in your flight,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Make me a child again just for tonight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But alas! this and my hungry heart-cry of</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>are alike vainly uttered. Having long had this in
mind, I now for the first time give to the world a
simple little story of the early part of my life. It
is a story of the war without much war in it. My
first recollections of the Civil War (which I always
thought very uncivil) are of the days of ’61,
after Sumter had been fired upon, when each night
one of the neighbors would come into our home,
and she and my parents would discuss the prospects
of war, which at first though a cloud no bigger
than a man’s hand, was even then lowering darkly
upon us. We didn’t get the newspapers daily then
as we do now, but whenever one could be obtained,
my mother would read the news aloud, while I lay
in my trundle bed, listening and cowering with
fear. Who shall say that children do not enter into
the spirit of current events? I had all a child’s
fear of war, and that fear hung over me, for a time,
as a dark cloud, for I thought the battles would be
fought at our very doors.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE JOURNEY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>IN September, 1862, my father, Dr. Coridon
Morrow, offered his services to his country, and
was appointed Assistant Surgeon of the 43d O. V.
I. His first work was at the battle of Corinth,
Miss., which occurred on the 4th and 5th of October.
Soon after the battle, owing to bad water
and change of climate, he was taken dangerously
ill, and wrote my mother an almost illegible scrawl,
begging her to come to him at once. We had broken
up housekeeping at our home in the village of
Bainbridge, Ohio, and gone to Aberdeen, on the
Ohio river, to spend the winter with relatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was almost an accident that I was taken on
this never-forgotten journey. There were four
children of us; two were taken and two were left.
I was at this time but little more than eight years
old, my baby sister, blue-eyed Mary, but five
months. At first thought, it seemed that my
mother could take but one, the baby, but here I
made the plea of my life to be allowed to go, promising
to be good and to help after we should get
there. There was little time for parley, and the
question was soon settled in my favor. We started
on Friday, October 31st, leaving the little
brother and sister to the care of kind friends in
the little brown cottage, on the banks of La Belle
Ohio. The river being at a low stage, no boats
were running, and we were compelled to go by
stage-coach to Georgetown, where we took supper
and remained till 3 o’clock the next morning, when
we were hurriedly aroused from our slumbers, and
without waiting for breakfast, we took another
stage-coach which conveyed us to Bethel. After a
hurried breakfast there, we took passage in a four-horse
omnibus which bore us to Cincinnati. I remember
many of the incidents of this ride: how we
stopped to take in passengers, some of whom were
women going into the city with their Saturday
marketing; and I can yet recall the appearance of
the stout old gentleman who, with cane in hand,
occupied the seat opposite me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arrived at Cincinnati, my first impression of
that great city was that we would be run over and
crushed by some of the numerous vehicles which
were constantly crossing and recrossing the crowded
streets, and through which we slowly threaded
our way to the Henrie House. At this hotel I had
my first experience with waiters. Soup was served
as the first course at dinner, and while looking leisurely
about me, a waiter came along and removed
my plate of soup, which I had barely tasted. I do
not remember what followed, as I had lost all interest
in the dinner, and I have never yet become
reconciled to the loss of that plate of soup.</p>

<p class='c000'>We could not get a train out of the city until
5 o’clock in the evening. There were a number of
guests in the parlor of the hotel, among them a
sweet-faced lady who sought to entertain and amuse
me. There was also a young man in the custody
of officers of the law, though for what offense I am
unable to say. His mother, a sad looking little
woman, was there to bid him goodby. He played
on the piano and sang beautiful songs for the entertainment
of those in the room. “All things
come to him that waits,” and as we waited, this
long afternoon came to an end. We were taken to
the depot in a cab, and this little ride cost my
mother one dollar. We traveled all night, reaching
Odin, Ill., about daylight, where we remained
until Monday evening, waiting for a train over the
Illinois Central railroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Odin at that time comprised the hotel, postoffice
and depot. There was a long board walk
leading from the hotel to the depot, which I traversed
many times during our enforced stay, scraping
acquaintance with the telegraph operator, giving
him my history, past, present and future so far as
I knew it. The country here was one vast expanse
of prairie land, and the wind raged ceaselessly.
Many long trains passed over the road on Sunday,
bearing troops to the South. I stood on the little
upper porch of the hotel, counting the cars and
watching the trains until they passed beyond my
vision. At this distant day I remember the appearance
of the room we occupied, even to the position
of the bed and stove, and in my mind’s eye I
can see my baby sister lying asleep on the bed, and
my mother sitting in a rocking chair near the center
of the room, engaged in conversation with a
lady from Mound City, Mo., who, like ourselves,
was waiting for a train.</p>

<p class='c000'>An amusing incident comes to my mind as I
speak of this lady. She was a later arrival than
ourselves, and had not yet heard the gong. As it
sounded the call to supper, she threw up her hands
in alarm, exclaiming, “Mercy on us, what is that!”
My mother told her what it meant, when with a
sigh of relief, she said, “Why, it’s enough to raise
the dead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On Monday evening, November 3, after we had
partaken of supper by lamplight, the long waited
for train arrived, which we hailed with joy after
our long, and to my mother, wearisome, delay.
Soon after stepping aboard I fell asleep, and knew
no more until 4 o’clock in the morning. Having
reached Cairo, Ill., at the confluence of the Ohio
and Mississippi rivers, we left the train, and in the
semi-darkness of the early morning, we were hurried
down the bank and on board the steamer City
of Alton, a <a id='mag' name='mag'></a>magnificent floating palace of the Mississippi,
which conveyed us to Columbus, Ky., a distance
of twenty miles. We were landed at the foot
of a long line of steep bluffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here occurs the first break in my memory of
this journey. I only know that it was completed
by rail, and that we traversed the entire length of
the State of Tennessee, from north to south, and
that I was a very tired little girl when we arrived
at Corinth, at 8 o’clock on the night of November
4th. We were met at the depot by an ambulance,
and driven to the Corona College Hospital, a mile
distant from the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we neared the building and surrounding
battle-field, a horrible odor, as of burning flesh,
greeted our nostrils, which the driver informed us
was caused by the burning of horses and mules
killed in the late battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the latter part of our journey we had fallen
in with a Mrs. Dr. Blaker, whose destination was
the same as our own, and who had come to minister
to a sick or wounded husband. We entered the
hospital together, and were first shown into the
Medical Director’s room, where the records were
examined. It took but a few moments for Mrs.
Blaker to learn that her husband was dead and
buried. I can hear her wails of distress yet. We
were more fortunate, and were soon ushered into
the room occupied by my father and several other sick
officers. The hospital was crowded, and there was
no extra room for us. Another cot was brought in,
an army blanket hung as a screen, and thus we
spent our first night in a southern hospital.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>CORONA COLLEGE HOSPITAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c007'>IT stood in the midst of the historic battle-field
and surrounding encampment. Prior to the
war, it was known as The Corona Female College.
It was a large, three-story structure of brick, with
portico in front supported by massive pillars, and
never was hospital more conveniently located with
reference to battle-field. To me it was the Castle
Beautiful, and even now, as I attempt to write of
it, the memories of that time come thronging and
surging through my brain, with such forceful rapidity,
each clamoring for utterance, that I scarce
know how to take up the tangled threads of warp and
woof, and weave them into a smooth and readable
story. The building was also known by the names
of General Hospital and Seminary Hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the happy freedom of childhood I roamed
about at my own sweet will, and I have given the
“cup of cold water” to more than one poor sick or
wounded soldier, as he lay on his bed of pain.
There was one in particular, whose room was opposite
our own: the door was mostly open, and he
would frequently call to me to come and talk to
him or hand him a drink of water. The first day
we were in the building, I made the rounds of our
ward on the second floor, with a lady nurse, Mrs.
Penfield. I afterward called down her wrath
upon my head by asking her if she had a field full
of pens. One scene of that day’s visit arises vividly
before me now, and I can draw a pen picture
of the white-faced soldier I saw, propped up in bed
with the nurse combing his hair, and bathing his
face and hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>I became familiar with scenes of sadness and
suffering, with the sight of pale faces, crutches and
armless sleeves, and, ever and anon a stiff form
wrapped in a blanket would be carried to the dead
house, thence to a soldier’s grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hospital continued crowded, and we occupied
the room with the officers several weeks. They
were Captain Hensler, of Peoria. Ill.; Captain
Armstrong, Lieut. Watt and several others whose
names I can not recall. My mother cooked by a
large, open fireplace, and shared all she had with
these sick men. There was plenty of raw material,
but it was so poorly prepared by the negroes about
the place that the men could not eat it with any relish.
A colored woman, who had been a slave, brought
provisions to our room each morning, and her one
theme was, “It’s mighty good.” Captain Hensler
convalesced rapidly, and with tears in his eyes, he
told my mother he owed it all to the nourishing food
she prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieut. Watt and I became great chums. While
in this room I wrote a letter to my teacher at home,
which he addressed for me, and upon learning that
the teacher was a young lady, he laughingly asked
me if I thought there would be any chance for him.
This letter was read to the school, and for a few
days I was quite famous in my native town.</p>

<p class='c000'>My baby sister and I soon became great favorites
in camp and hospital. On the night of our
arrival the baby cried, and the word went around
from room to room: “There’s a baby in the house.
Where did it come from? Bring it in.” And in
due time she was taken into the rooms where there
were no contagious diseases. The men were much
cheered by her presence, and one of the doctors said
it was “quite a treat to hear a baby cry.” Dr.
Robins, the surgeon in charge of our ward, would
carry her about the room at each visit he made,
sometimes taking her down stairs into the hall and
out into the grounds about the building, I following
wherever he went. The doctor called her his
“little rosebud.” One day she scratched his face
until the blood came, and he bore the marks several
days. I can see him now, a slight, fair-haired
young fellow, and, strange as it may seem, after
the lapse of all these years, I can hear the very
sound of his voice, as, upon entering the room, he
would throw back his head and laughingly call out
“Where is my Little Rosebud?” He told us of the
friends he left at home, but alas! for them, he died
the following summer of smallpox, in Memphis,
Tennessee.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>IN CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>OVER the roadway leading from hospital to
camp, I have doubtless traveled many miles.
The large space was thickly dotted with white
tents, temporary homes of the brave defenders of
our country. Here I became familiar with martial
music. I returned with “taps” and arose with
“revielle,” and to this day the sound of fife and
drum stirs every drop of patriotic blood in my
veins and takes me back to the days of camp life
at Corinth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whenever I hear the fife and the drum</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the bugles wildly play,</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart is stirred like a frightened bird,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And struggles to break away:</div>
      <div class='line'>For the tramp of the volunteers I hear</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the Captain’s sharp command,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left! left! left! he is near,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And drilling his eager band.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here we met brave, grand Mother Bickerdyke,
who was such a tower of strength to her “boys,”
and indeed, to all who came in touch with her. She
had a large tent in the midst of the encampment,
where she prepared nourishing food and dispensed
hospital stores. When she learned our situation,
that my mother prepared food with but a few poor
cooking utensils, for ourselves, a nurse and the
officers in our room, she immediately invited us to
come to her tent for all the cooked food we needed.
It fell upon me for the most part to carry it, not
only for ourselves, but for some of the other inmates
of the hospital. I made countless trips up
and down the long, winding stairway, and many
nights I could not sleep for tired and aching limbs,
but I made no complaint. I was keeping my promise
of being useful and was serving my country.
My mother, however, saw that it was too much for
me, and called a halt on it to some extent. We
had a nurse, an artilleryman, whose name was
Cole, but unlike “Old King Cole,” he was not a
“jolly old soul.” He growled and grumbled constantly,
and in these days we would call him a
“kicker.” One day I started from the tent with
more than I could carry, a glass of cherry preserves
fell, the glass was broken and contents spilled.
The next day, Cole was sent with me to assist in
carrying our dinner. As we passed the cherries
still lying in the dust, Cole growled out, “Just look
at them good cherries; you ought to be made get
down and lick ’em up.” I regretted the loss of the
cherries as much as Cole, but I did not feel called
upon to “get down and lick ’em up.” Cole meant
well, however, and was a brave soldier, and if living
I would like to know where he is today, for we took
many walks together, from Mother B.’s tent up to
the big brick house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mother B. had an assistant, whose name
was Frank Williams, from St. Paul, Minn. He had
been sick, and not being able for field service, was
detailed for hospital duty. He and I were great
friends, and he often came to our room and talked
with my parents. He was a Christian, and sometimes
had prayers in our room. One day I entered
the tent, when to my dismay I found it full of men,
and a prayer meeting in progress. I was about to
beat a hasty retreat, when my friend Frank very
kindly invited me to come in, found a seat for me,
and put in my hands a little leaflet bearing upon
its white surface the hymn beginning, “Just as I
am, without one plea.” A chaplain conducted the
services; my friend and some of the other soldiers
offered prayer. I was the only child present. I
have no recollection of any woman being there, although
Mother B. or one of the lady nurses may
have been. That prayer meeting was indelibly impressed
upon my childish mind, and even now stands
out clear cut and in bold relief, over every other
prayer meeting I have ever attended. And, let me
be where I may when “Just as I Am” is sung, the
mingled joys and sorrows of the long years vanish
as it were, and again I am a little child in that
prayer tent on a Southern battle-field, and again I
hear those bearded men singing as with one voice:</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>TOUR OF BATTLEFIELD AND DINNER TO MR. CROOKS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>ONE of our fellow townsmen, Mr. Nathan W.
Crooks by name, now a resident of Washington
C. H., Ohio, was in camp at Corinth at this time.
Escorted by him, my mother and I made the tour of
the battle-field. Mr. Crooks carried my little sister
in his arms, and to this day, upon occasion, introduces
her to friends as the little girl he carried all
over the battle-field of Corinth, with the accent on
the <em>inth</em>. We visited the R. R. cut where my father
held his emergency hospital, with shot and shell
screaming and bursting all around him; we stood
within the enclosure of Fort Robinet, where brave
Col. Rogers of the Texas Brigade fell, and was buried
with his colors. And little I reck’d the day
would come when I would thrill with patriotic pride
at the recollection of having stood on the parapet
of this historic fort, with “Old Glory” floating
proudly in the breeze above me, while at my feet,
in the trench surrounding the fort, lay friend and
foe, buried in one common grave. As one has fittingly
written of them, “They sleep, and glory is
their sentinel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I have wandered all over this field of battle.
My playground was that portion occupied by the
14th Wisconsin during the fight, and of the many
minnie balls, grape and cannister I picked up on
this memorable spot, but one battered minnie ball
remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Crooks had been my Sunday school teacher
at home, and the morning he and some of the other
“boys” left for the war, I heard my teacher in the
public school offer up prayer in behalf of the
“brave boys who had gone forth to defend their
country’s honor.” As her words fell upon my ears
I little dreamed that in a few short months I would
follow, and meet with these same “boys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After we had been in the hospital some little
time my mother invited Mr. Crooks to dinner, and
Oh, what a dinner that was! at least Mr. Crooks
said it was the first white man’s meal he had eaten
since he left home. My mother cooked a portion of
it by the fireplace, Mother Bickerdyke made a generous
contribution, and the cook of the officers’ mess
donated a very fine pudding. The butter—but the
less said about it the better—at least in regard to
its age and strength. It was of the canned variety,
but Mr. Crooks thought it better than no butter at
all, and promising to come again another day, jovially
walked off with a can of it under his arm. He
kept his word and visited us a number of times at
the college hospital. Years after the war was over
he told us that the mere mention of our father’s
name called up visions of an old gray army blanket
given him by our father as they were parting on
one occasion, when but for it his bed would have
been the cold, bare earth, his covering the canopy
of heaven.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>OUR QUAKER FRIENDS. MY ILLNESS. SUPPER IN THE MESS ROOM</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>JUST as my father recovered sufficiently to walk
about a little, he was seized with a violent attack
of inflammatory rheumatism, and lay helpless
for several weeks. During this time we had four
men nurses who assisted my mother in caring for
him. They were ward-master Gilmore, Cole, the
artilleryman before spoken of, Thomas Terrie, a
Scotchman, and Thomas Enslow, from one of the
New England States. The latter two were my devoted
friends, and gave me little trinkets and keepsakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The room adjoining ours was occupied by an
old Quaker lady and her son. The mother’s name
was Ann Roman, the boy’s Isaac. He was wounded,
and she had come to take him home, but he was
not able to travel, and a furlough could not immediately
be secured. They were detained several weeks
and we became great friends. They were the first
Quakers I had ever seen, and “auntie” Roman’s
Quaker garb and quaint “thees” and “thous” were
a novelty to me, and I sometimes addressed her in
her own dialect, much to her amusement. Isaac
suffered much from his wound, and was a little inclined
to be cross, while I was greatly inclined to
be noisy. Many times in trying to suppress a laugh
I would giggle, and “auntie” would say, “Thee
had better go into the hall, where thee can give
vent to the giggles;” and fearing a scolding
from Isaac, I always went. But Isaac grew better,
and through a plea <a id='made' name='made'></a>made by Mother B. to Gen. Grant,
then at Memphis, a furlough was secured, and
mother and son went to their home at Old’s Post
Office, Washington County, Ohio. I have their address
yet, written in my little cramped hand, on a
faded bit of blue paper, at auntie’s dictation. After
their departure we were given their room, which
we occupied during the rest of our stay in the
hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here I had a severe attack of quinsy, and
was very sick for several days and nights. I had
a burning fever, and in my delirium would cry out
for water from the “cool well” on the bank of the
river, in far away Ohio. The water at Corinth
was not satisfying. It had to be boiled before
drinking, and the tin fruit can on the window ledge
outside was a familiar “institution.” Everything
which had no particular name was called an “institution.”
A place where cooking was done was
called a “shebang,” and I was always running across
one. In one of my morning rambles I came upon a
little bake shop where bread and pies were made
for the camp. A man was sitting on the steps,
who at once entered into conversation with me.
Learning that I was there with my parents, he went
in and got a pie which he told me to take to my
mother. It became so common for me to come home
carrying something good to eat, that about the hospital
they called me “The little forager.”</p>

<p class='c000'>My mother and I took supper with the officers
in their mess room one evening. I came to their
door just at their supper hour. They invited me to
remain. With the sublime confidence of childhood
I took a seat at the table with them. There were
a number of them and they had a man cook. My
mother coming to look after me, was invited to partake
of the evening meal in such a cordial manner
that she could not but accept. I remember that
there was no fork at my plate and I was too timid to
make it known, but one of the officers soon noticed
my dilemma and the omission was promptly supplied.
I do not know the names of any of these
men, but I know they were gentlemen and soldiers,
and I have never forgotten their gallant and courteous
treatment of my mother and myself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>SUNDAY IN CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>THERE is of necessity in a large camp more or
less stir and activity on the Sabbath day, even
when no battle is on, but even here there seemed to
be a difference between it and other days. There
was a hush and stillness in the air that seemed to
proclaim, “It is the holy Sabbath day.” Religious
services were held by chaplains and pious soldiers.
There were several lady nurses, and they occupied
a tent near the college building. Their names were:
Miss Adaline Williams, Miss Babcock, Mrs. Cunningham
and Mrs. Yates. Mrs. Penfield did not
remain long, as there seemed to be some friction
between her and the other ladies. Always a welcome
visitor to this tent, I was in and out all day
Sunday, but with one restraint. I was told
that I must not talk or ask questions, as that was
their day for writing letters to friends in the North.
They had leather portfolios, which they used as
writing desks on their laps. Miss Williams and
my mother became great friends, and I was very
fond of her. I made many visits with her and for
years the little red-backed books she gave me from
the Christian Commission supplies were counted
among my treasures. My life on Sundays was
about the same as on other days. I visited the big
“shebang” three times a day, wandered around
from tent to tent, and sat for hours on the steps of
the portico wishing for companionship of my own
age, myself and sister being the only children in
the hospital and entire encampment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE TISHOMINGO HOTEL. MY SCHOOL AND OTHER INCIDENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>THE scene changes. We were now ordered to
turn. We “moved” in an ambulance, my father
being taken on a cot, and were given quarters in the
Tishomingo Hotel. The old Tishomingo House!
Can I ever forget it? The historic, dilapidated old
hotel through which a cannon ball passed during
the progress of battle. We were given a large, cheerless
room in the second story; the floor was bare,
the four large windows were each guiltless of blind
or curtain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our bed consisted of two cots placed together,
with an army blanket to each for covering. The
nights were cold, and we would have suffered had
not my mother arisen through the night and replenished
the fire. There was a large stove in the
room and we had a plentiful supply of wood. The
hotel was used as a hospital, although it was not
full at this time, there being a number of vacant
rooms. I remember but one nurse here, a Miss
Johnson. We were great friends, and I spent as
much time in her room as in our own. I frequently
took walks with her about town. I went with her
one morning to call on Dr. Norman Gay and family,
of Columbus, O., who had roomed for a time at
the hotel, but who afterward rented furnished
rooms in a private house in another part of the
town. On our way we passed the Iuka House
and several sutlers’ stores. I had not been long in
the Tishomingo House until I made the acquaintance
of the cook, a curly-headed young fellow
whose name was John Storms, of Ohio.</p>

<p class='c000'>Part of the time we took our meals in the dining
room with the doctors and officers. By “we” I
mean my mother and myself; my father not being able
to leave the room his meals were carried to him.
At other times we all took our meals in our own
room. Those who ate in the dining-room were:
Dr. Gay, wife and son, Dr. Spicer, Dr. Huntington,
Captain Pemberton, Chaplain Estabrook, Miss
Johnson, ourselves and many others, comers and
goers, whose names I can not now recall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Across the railroad and directly opposite the
hotel was another encampment, and reveille and
lights out were again daily and nightly sounds.
Gen. Hunter had his headquarters in a large white
house not far away, and night after night I have
sat on the upper porch listening entranced to the
regimental band, as it played Hail Columbia, Star
Spangled Banner, Red, White and Blue, Rally round
the Flag, and America. Each night this band
would play from dark until bedtime, and I could
not be induced to leave my post until the last note
died away in silence. Many events come to my
mind as I write of this time. One day a man was
brought in who had been accidentally shot through
both thighs. While sitting on the floor of a box
car a jolt dislodged a musket from where it was
standing. As it fell, it was discharged, and the
man being in direct range, the ball passed through
both limbs. Amputation was decided upon as a
forlorn hope of saving his life. Not knowing the
time fixed upon for the operation, I passed down
the stairway leading through the Medical Director’s
room, which was also the operating room, and
there, on the operating table, under the influence
of chloroform, white and lifeless-looking, surrounded
by the doctors, lay the poor fellow undergoing
the awful ordeal of having both legs taken off.
Sick at heart, I hurried on and delayed my return
until I felt sure the operation was well over with.
But alas! the hope of saving his life was a vain
one, as he died a few days later.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here we one day received a visit from
our old friend Frank Williams, of the Seminary
Hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>He came to tell us goodby, as he expected to
leave with Mother Bickerdyke in a few days for
La Grange, Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days later he sent a friend to have my
picture taken at the little gallery built up against
one end of the hotel, and authorized him to spare
no expense in securing it. Photography was not
then the fine art it is today and this picture was an
excellent sample of the old time ambrotype and
was placed in the handsomest case the establishment
afforded at a cost of $4.00. By this time the
agent of my friend had fallen in love with me, and
wished a picture for himself, which with the consent
of my parents, he secured at a cost of $2.50.
Some months later both these pictures were given
my father at Memphis, but were one night stolen
from his tent with all the contents of his satchel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the thief ever see these lines, repent,
and return the pictures, he will receive my full and
free forgiveness and everlasting gratitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>I never saw my old friend after the day he
called to bid us goodby, but received several letters
from him after returning home, and then all knowledge
of him ceased. He has doubtless passed into
the Great Beyond long ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were a great many refugees or contrabands
in Corinth. President Lincoln’s proclamation
of Emancipation had not yet been issued; yet
the slaves were practically free. Some of them had
quarters near the hotel. Among them was a quaint
old couple known as Uncle Sandy and Aunt Katy
with whom we became well acquainted. Aunt Katy
did washing for us and was frequently in our room.</p>

<p class='c000'>My mother bought a large piece of homespun
cotton cloth of her such as was used by the slave
women for dresses and aprons. After Aunt Katy
had tasted of freedom, she thought “Massa Linkum”
a grand man, and the best friend the slave
had.</p>

<p class='c000'>My mother one day asked her what she thought
the “Yankees” looked like before she saw them.
“Well, hunny,” said she, “I thought they was some
kind of wild animals with ho’ns on their heads and
they would eat me up,” and then she laughed until
her fat sides shook as she realized what kind of an
animal the Yankee really was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Uncle Sandy told us that when he first entered
within the Union lines he ate so much he became
very sick and thought he was going to die, and
that the only reason he hated to die was because
he could never eat any more.</p>

<p class='c000'>From among the children of the refugees I organized
and taught a school on the upper veranda
of the Tishomingo, which was situated at the crossing
of the Memphis &amp; Charleston and the Mobile
&amp; Ohio railroads. The pupils were all girls, some
older and some younger than myself, and so far as
I have ever been able to learn to the contrary, this
was the first crude, little contraband school organized
in the great state of Mississippi, and humble
though it was, I feel very proud of my share in
it. I taught them the alphabet, and how to make
a few figures. Our text books were the heads of
newspapers, and cards with figures numbering the
rooms, which we tore off the doors. Many trains
passed our open air schoolroom daily, and each
whistle that pierced the air was a signal to suspend
lessons, and teacher and pupils alike would scramble
to the front, and leaning far over the rotten
railing, would wave and cheer at the blue-coated
soldiers being borne onward to victory or defeat,
life or death, God alone knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the time came all too soon when the Tishomingo
House was ordered evacuated, as it was
to be again used for hotel purposes. We received
instructions to go to Jackson, Tennessee, sixty
miles north, and one sunny Sabbath morn we boarded
the train for that place, and it was many a day
before I ceased to regret my dusky pupils and playmates.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was with sad hearts we left Corinth. We
had been here so long it had become like home to
us, and we were much attached to the place, the
nurses, and our soldier friends. But the fortunes
of war are many and varied, and there is no sure
abiding place in the army.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>JACKSON</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>SOME of the happiest days of my childhood
were spent in Jackson, magnolia-clad, holly-decked
Jackson.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember the journey very well. We went
in a box car, my father on his cot. We had nothing
for seats but some boxes. There were armed
soldiers on our train. We passed little squads of
soldiers at intervals along the roadside, some of
whom with stacked arms were engaged in cooking by
their campfires. Sometimes the train would
stop a few minutes, and some of the “boys” would
come up and talk to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arrived at Jackson, we were taken in an ambulance
to hospital No. 2, where they were too full
to receive us. We were invited to dinner, however,
and were then assigned quarters in a large hotel
called the Manassas House. The hotel property
was owned by a Mr. Tolliver. There were two landlords
or proprietors, Hotellen and Wilcox by name.
There was no landlady but a housekeeper known
as Irish Mary. There was also an Irishman employed
as a “handy man,” whose name was Mike.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jackson was a beautiful little city situated between
two railroads. It contained many handsome
residences set back in well kept grounds. It was
in possession of the Union troops. Gen. Sullivan
was in command. Col. Lawler had his headquarters
near the hotel. The 103d Illinois and other regiments
were in camp here. There were two large
brick hospitals, known as No. 1 and No. 2, situated
on opposite sides of the town. Dr. Haversett was in
charge of both. Miss Adaline Williams had been
sent here from Corinth and was assigned to duty
in No. 1, where I made daily visits passing on the
way two huge piles of cannon balls stacked up in
pyramidal form.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE MEASLES</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>WHILE in the Manassas House we had many
pleasures and some sorrow. In room No. 19
“Little Rosebud” and I had measles, which nearly
cost us our lives. We took it of one of the colored
chambermaids, who died before we got well. We
could see the negro quarters from the back window
of our room, and my mother propped me up in bed
with pillows, one Sunday afternoon, that I might
see poor Ann placed in a common road wagon and
hauled away for burial. Little Rosebud’s life was
despaired of several times, it being thought one
night that she could not live until morning. We
had many kind friends during this time of trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Huntington came over from Hospital No.
2 several times each day to attend us, and to him
my parents always gave the credit of having saved
my sister’s life.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we were sick, our former nurse, Thomas
Torrie, came to see us. When he first entered the
room I knew him, but soon after, the fever arose,
and I became delirious. He was a very religious
man and my parents asked him to pray with them.
I remember yet the impressions of that hour. It
seemed to me that we were all in an old barn, with
long, dusty cobwebs hanging from the high rafters,
and as I saw the three kneeling not far from
my bed, they seemed afar off, and the tones of the
prayer sounded faint and distant to my fever-thickened
ears. A few days later our friend Thomas
visited us again and found us much improved. The
fever had left me, my mind was clear and I was
able to talk to him. He loaned me a stencil plate,
ink and brush, and I amused myself by marking the
hotel linen with his name. I made a rapid
recovery, but alas! my voice was gone, and for
weeks I spoke only in whispers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE STOLEN PRESERVES</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c007'>ABOUT the time of our recovery, the housekeeper,
“Irish Mary,” took the measles and was
quite sick for some days. She had been in the habit
of giving out the linen and towels for the bedrooms
and always carried the key to the linen closet, a
large wardrobe which stood in one end of the hall.
During her illness each lady boarder looked after
the supplies for her own room, and would obtain
the key when anything was needed. One day a
doctor’s wife, an intimate friend of ours, came to
our room in great excitement, saying she had found
a large jar of peach preserves in the wardrobe, and
that she “was going to have some of them.” She
rushed down stairs to the dining room, secured a
saucer and spoon, returned and dipped out a bountiful
supply. By this time several other ladies had
“caught on,” and they all swarmed about that jar
as flies around a molasses barrel. One lady with a
“down-east” accent, who always said “gude” for
good, ate her portion, smacked her lips and said,
“My, but they are gude!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not mention these ladies’ names, but it is
not because I have forgotten them. I remember
their names and faces distinctly, and should they
ever see this word picture they will readily recognize
themselves and their part in it. It is needless
to say that I came in for my share of the “stolen
sweets.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE THREATENED BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>IN my visits to the City Hotel and other places it
was my delight to scale the “breast works” that
barred the way, built of huge bales of cotton belonging
to northern speculators. Cotton, which had
long reigned king in the South, was now “Uncle
Sam’s” servant and was made to do his bidding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vast quantities were stored away in warehouses
and depots, awaiting shipment, when one night
the cry went around, “The rebels are coming, <a id='the' name='the'></a>the
rebels are coming.” The cotton was seized by
the military authorities, piled up in the form of a
wall around the most exposed parts of the town
and earth thrown over it. The soldiers worked all
night in constructing these fortifications. Ah! how
well I remember the night. We were awakened
near the hour of midnight and told to prepare to fly
at a moment’s warning, as the rebels were rapidly
advancing on Jackson. We packed our few belongings,
and after listening a while with bated breath,
lay down again with our clothes on and slept securely
till morning. With the morning’s dawn
preparations were made for a mighty battle. Artillery
was planted in different parts of the town,
three lines of battle were formed, one of them being
drawn up in front of the hotel, and there the
soldiers stood all day, their bayonets flashing and
glittering in the sunlight. The greatest excitement
and enthusiasm prevailed; officers and orderlies
on horseback went dashing by, here, there
and everywhere, but the battle was never fought,
for the rebels never came. Four days later, on the
20th of December, the same troops, headed by Earl
Van Dorn, a dashing young cavalry officer, entered
Holly Springs, Miss., surprised and captured the
Federal forces, which they at once released on parole,
fired the Union stores, blew up the arsenal
and paymaster’s quarters, and gained such a victory
withal, as to set all their hearts adancing, and
all their flags aflutter. It was a great day for the
people of Holly Springs, and they yet speak of it
as the “glorious, glorious twentieth.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHRISTMAS IN JACKSON</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>FOR a time we “fared sumptuously every day,”
but there came a time when, owing to burned
bridges and blockades, <a id='comm' name='comm'></a>communication was entirely
cut off with Cairo, Ill., which was our base of
supplies, and the fare became very scant. For
several days we had no coffee, but in some manner
the landlord managed to secure 50 pounds, for
which he paid $50.00.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Christmas Day, 1862, our breakfast consisted
of tea, bread, and pickled pigs’ feet; dinner
the same with the addition of dried apple pie. In
the afternoon we went, by invitation of Major
Winn, to Bolivar, twenty-eight miles south of Jackson.
I shall never forget the pleasure of that little
war-time excursion. We stayed two hours and
watched the boys in camp getting supper. One
little fellow was making hash in a camp kettle
near the railroad track where our train stood. He
stirred it with a bayonet; it was very thin, and he
said he didn’t know whether to call it hash or soup,
but that he could thicken it with cotton, which
was stacked up in great walls all about him. I can
hear his merry, ringing laugh yet. My father’s
regiment was in camp here, and we met his Colonel.
That Colonel is now Brigadier General Wager
Swayne, of New York city, and I often wonder if
Gen. Swayne remembers that Christmas afternoon
of 1862 as well as I do.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the ride down to Bolivar was memorable, the
return trip was even more so. There was supposed
to be some danger of our train being fired into, and
no lights were allowed. Part of the way lay
through the woods, and our phantom train glided
along in darkness and silence, for neither whistle
was blown nor bell rung as we made the perilous
little run through the enemy’s country. With a
child’s confidence I knew and felt no fear. We
arrived safely at the hotel at 8 p. m. and went immediately
to the dining room, where we had some
more pigs’ feet and dried apple pie. We didn’t
hang up our stockings that Christmas Eve. There
was nothing to put in them, unless it were minnie
balls, and they were needed far worse in the muskets
at that time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE DINING ROOM</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>IN the large dining room of the hotel were eight
tables, and there was a black waiter for each
table. We ate at what was known as the Colonel’s
table, and Tom was our waiter. He was as black
as the “ace of spades,” but the very pink of politeness.
I became so familiar with his “formula” or
bill of fare, that I can repeat it now. In times of
plenty it was, “Roast beef, roast pork, co’n beef, or
meat pie.” Also, “beef-steak or po’k-steak.” If
one chose the former, Tom would ask, “Well done
or rare?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Many times there was such a rush for the dining
room that it almost amounted to a mob, and both
doors leading into it were kept locked. Several
trains arrived at noon, and emptied themselves of
passengers into the Manassas House, and many
times a lot of hungry soldiers came pouring in just
as dinner was ready. On one occasion a revolver
was fired in the mad rush for entrance. The regular
boarders were instructed to knock at the rear
door, and my timid little tap was responded to as
promptly as that of the wearer of gold cord and
glittering shoulder straps.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>INMATES AND INCIDENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>THERE were many Northern people at the hotel,
and among them we formed pleasant friendships
and acquaintances, and visited around from
room to room. Those whom I most distinctly
remember were Dr. De Forest, wife, and little
daughter, of Troy, Ohio; Mr. James Leighton and
wife, of Vermont; Captain Ford and wife, Mr. and
Mrs. Munn, Mrs. Captain Birch, Mrs. Webb, and
“Camp” Dick Robinson, of Kentucky. There were
a number of cotton speculators here. Several Jews
by the name of Levi from Cincinnati, a Mr. Coan
and a Mr. Cohn, from Columbus, Ohio, and Colonels,
Majors, Captains and Lieutenants galore. We also
met a Dr. Mitchell and wife, of Illinois, who boarded
at the City Hotel. Much of the time I was the
only child about, and was petted and spoiled to my
heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c000'>The water supply at Jackson was very scant,
and there was not enough for domestic purposes at
the hotel. There was a well in the yard, but its
supply was soon exhausted. The negroes would
haul it in barrels from the Forked Deer river, and
many times I have watched them loading up the
empty barrels, and then unloading them full of
water upon their return.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a strange coincidence my mother was now
within a few miles of her father’s unknown and
unmarked grave, he having died and been buried
on the banks of the Forked Deer many years before,
when she was a child too small to remember him.
A sad rendering of the words, “So near and yet so
far.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Many incidents occurred at the hotel, amusing
and otherwise. A little newsboy called Johnny
was a frequent visitor, and a great favorite with
the ladies. I saw him one afternoon select several
one dollar bills from a handful of paper money.
These he folded very carefully and then drew his
knife blade right through the center. Several of
the ladies remonstrated with him, but he only
laughed, saying each piece was worth fifty cents.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Camp” Dick Robinson, so called from the
Union soldiers having camped on his land in Kentucky,
was an eccentric character. He occupied
room No. 23, and seemed to think the world in general
and the hotel in particular were made for his
especial accommodation. One day, having written
a letter and lacking an envelope, he came out into
the hall in a towering rage, shouting at the top of
his voice: “I want an envelope. Can’t I have an
envelope? Why can’t I have an envelope?” Several
doors were opened, heads thrust out, and the
much needed envelope supplied. Later on No. 23
was used as a prison. A female spy was arrested
and confined in this room a week or more. Her
meals were carried to her and a guard stood at the
door, musket in hand, night and day.</p>

<p class='c000'>One Saturday night a lady arrived, and the
next morning took her sewing and descended to the
parlor, where she occupied herself with her work
until some one reminded her that it was Sunday.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another day two ladies from New Orleans, both
young and fair, dressed in deep mourning, stopped
for dinner and to await a train. They had with
them a beautiful boy, about my own age, with
long, yellow curls. They called him Percy. They
remained but a few hours, but Percy and I played
together on the veranda, and as they left, he cried
for me to kiss him goodbye, and after he was gone,
I cried because I wouldn’t.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>FEEDING THE “BOYS” FROM HOME</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>ONE dark, dreary morning, when the rain was
pouring down in torrents, a lot of soldiers took
refuge in the lower hall of the Manassas House.
I soon learned that there were four “boys” from
home among them, that they had been out all night,
were cold, wet, and hungry, and to my mind, hunger
was the worst of all. To me, in those days,
a soldier was greater than a king, and is yet for
that matter, and I felt that something must be
done. I went to my mother, that never-failing
refuge in all my childish sorrows and perplexities,
and with tearful eyes appealed to her for advice and
help. With a smile she said, “Can you not go to
Brown, and ask him for something for ‘our boys?’”
For it was useless to think of feeding them all, in
the then depleted state of the hotel larder. Brown
was the steward, and the one being among all the
hotel people of whom I stood in awe. But to
Brown I went, and, to my delight, he gave me all
that was left from breakfast. To the best of my
recollection, that lunch consisted of bread, meat
and cheese.</p>

<p class='c000'>I divided it as best I could among the four,
whose names I herewith give: George Harmon, V.
K. Kelley, Wesley Jackman and J. A. Tulleys. A
sorry picture they made, with the water dripping
from their faded blue overcoats in little puddles on
the floor, the little girl standing in their midst,
with sorrow in her heart, because she could not obtain
food for the other poor men looking wistfully
on. Perhaps not one of the living members of the
quartet will remember this little episode in his
army life, but that rainy morning’s scene has never
faded from my memory. George Harmon has been
“mustered out” and lies, awaiting the “bugle call”
to the “General Assembly,” in a country graveyard
a few miles from town. James A. Tulleys<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> is a
prominent citizen of Red Cloud, Nebraska. The
other two are citizens of this place and I see them
almost every day.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Mr. Tulleys answered the “roll call” January 21, 1901.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>A DAY AT THE CITY HOTEL</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>OUR friends the De Forests, after boarding for a
time at the Manassas, removed their quarters
to the City Hotel.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had taken under their protecting wing a
little yellow girl by the name of “Mandy.” She
was sent one day to invite my mother and another
lady to spend the day at the City Hotel. Mandy
and I had traveled the road many times, and we
put our heads together and determined to take
them by way of the long line of cotton defences,
instead of the open street, as we could just as well
have done. Imagine their discomfiture and our
glee as they faced the frowning wall over which
they had to climb as best they could. How we
laughed and shouted as we scaled the “works” with
the agility of young monkeys.</p>

<p class='c000'>The low-ceiled parlor of the City Hotel, with
its dark, large-figured Brussels carpet, is yet a familiar
feature to me, as we gathered in it after
dinner and listened to Mrs. Dr. Mitchell relate how
they used to go to church in a wagon drawn by an
ox team, at her girlhood’s home in Illinois.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>VAGRANT MEMORIES</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_7 c007'>I OFTEN think of how recklessly I wandered
around alone at Jackson. I became familiar
with its streets, and if the years have not made too
many changes in its appearance, were I there today,
I could go right to the Manassas House and
Hospital No. 1. No. 2 I did not become so <a id='fam' name='fam'></a>familiar
with, as I was there but once. There was a little
white house in the cut some distance up the Memphis
&amp; Charleston railroad, where lived a family
by the name of Clark. I went there many times
to play with the children. We would walk the
railroad ties until we saw the trains coming, when
we would leap upon the porch and wave our handkerchiefs
and hats at the soldiers as they passed
rapidly by, the track being but a few feet from the
house. The trains were mostly made up of box
cars, which were literally alive with soldiers inside
and out, who would wave their caps and give
us cheer upon cheer in return for our salute, doubtless
taking us for little “rebels.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I recall and write these trivial events, those
old, sweet days seem very near, and I have but to
close my eyes to fancy that as a little child I am
again running through the long hall of the Manassas
to the upper piazza, watching for George, the hotel
clerk, as he came from the postoffice, it having
been prearranged between us that whenever there
was a letter for us from Ohio, he was to hold it up
so I could see it, otherwise I was to know there was
none. The postoffice, now in charge of the military,
was in the depot and in full view of the hotel, and
the railroad ran parallel with both. I almost lived
on the veranda and saw every train that passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a large encampment in the open
space across the railroad, and opposite the hotel.
Lieutenant Pease, one of the boarders, had a telescope,
which he would adjust properly for me and
I would spend hours looking <a id='through' name='through'></a>through it, watching
the soldiers, as they performed their daily camp
duties. I could see them cooking, washing and
hanging their clothes to dry. Many times we have
witnessed drill and dress parade from the veranda.
Lieutenant Pease was a tall, dark, quiet gentleman,
a great reader and a great friend of mine.
The first copies of Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Magazine
and Ballou’s Monthly I ever saw were given
me by him, and I can yet recall some of the stories
I read in them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>CORINTH WAR EAGLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>THERE was published in Corinth a paper called
<cite>The Corinth War Eagle</cite>. Its editor and publisher
was a patriotic young man from the North,
whose name was Elbridge Dwight Fenn. I remember
him distinctly, although I did not see him
while at Corinth, but later on at Jackson, where he
was largely in evidence. His name and handsome
physique would have fitted him to figure as the
hero in a two-volume novel. I saw him frequently
at the City Hotel. He was full of life and spirits.
I saw him one day dancing about the upper corridor
with a looking glass under his arm, the lady boarders
and chambermaids looking on in great glee.
On the day of the expected battle, Fenn was seemingly
everywhere. While a number of us were
standing on the balcony at the Manassas viewing
the troops as they stood in battle array, he came
dashing up with a red sash tied about him from
shoulder to waist, mounted on a coal-black horse.
One of the ladies called to him, saying, “When
are the rebels coming, Fenn?” Raising his arm
high in air, he shouted, “Never!” and rode away
as rapidly as he had come. We brought a copy of
the <cite>War Eagle</cite> home with us, and after many years,
when it was almost worn out, I cut the least worn
articles from its columns, and they adorn the pages
of my war scrapbook. The issue I have bears the
date of September 18, 1862. There is a flag at the
head of the <a id='edit' name='edit'></a>editorial column, and the motto is, “Be
just and fear not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the articles I have preserved is an account
of a visit to the hospital, written by the
editor himself; also complimentary references to
the 17th and 7th Ill. regiments; Harmony Among
Regimental Officers, Flag Presentation to the 17th
Wisconsin, an Irish regiment, with speeches by the
Chaplain and Captain. The paper also contains
several poems.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE SUTLERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>THE Sutler was an institution of the army. It
is useless to describe him. Every old soldier
knows him. There were two of “him” here, Patrick
and Keene by name, who kept a store in a
small room adjoining the hotel; in fact, it was built
against it and a step from the veranda led into the
store. How clear and familiar it all is to me today,
the counter on one side of the room, the little stove
and bench on the other. I made many visits to the
little store and was always kindly received by its
gentlemanly proprietors. Mr. Patrick wore a cap
and always had it on whether indoors or out, and
when not busy, mostly sat on the counter. On New
Year’s Day, 1863, Mr. Keene gave me a pocket handkerchief.
I have owned since then many dainty
creations of lace and embroidery, called by courtesy
handkerchiefs, but none that ever gave me such
real pleasure as did that large square of coarse
cotton cloth, with a border of blue stars all around
it, and in each corner an eagle with shield and stars.
But in coming home I left it on the train, much to
my regret. While in Jackson we secured a 64-pound
cannon ball which we were very anxious
to bring home with us, but finding it impossible to
do so my mother left it in care of Messrs. Patrick
and Keene, expecting my father to send it another
time, but after leaving Jackson he never returned,
and thus we lost our much prized relic.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>DAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c007'>WHILE at the Tishomingo in Corinth we acquired
a boy 17 years old, black and raw-boned.
His name was Dan Weaver. I do not know
how we got him, but having once gotten him we
had him. Having learned that where we were he
was always sure of something to eat, he was determined
to stay with us. We took him to Jackson
and he became a part of us. He made himself useful
about the hotel, and assisted my mother in taking
care of the baby. He would sit with her in his
arms and sing by the hour, and sometimes in his
earnestness the big tears would flow down his
black, shiny cheeks. His favorite song was “Dixie”
and over and over and again he would sing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Away down south in the land of cotton,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Look away, away, away.</div>
      <div class='line'>In Dixie’s land</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll take my stand.</div>
      <div class='line'>And live and die a “secesh” man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the “secesh” part of it was a huge joke
with Dan, and was but a bit of ironical humor on
his part. There was nothing Dan wouldn’t do for
“Little Missy,” as he always called me. I had developed
a mania for collecting empty cigar boxes,
and he would scour the town and camp to secure
them for me. I was very proud of my collection,
and I had them of every size and shape, stacked
up on either side of the bureau until they reached
the top of the looking-glass. I fully expected to
bring them home with me, and was bitterly disappointed
when emphatically informed that I could
not do so. Since then an empty cigar box has
always had a peculiar charm for me, and I never
see one or inhale the pungent odor of cedar and
tobacco combined but the interior of No. 19 appears
before me, and I wonder who fell heir to my beloved
boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dan was a good boy in the main, but in an
evil hour he learned to play cards. He came home
one day very angry with a colored comrade, who
had not played fair with him, as he thought. He
took “Little Rosebud” up and began to sing to her
as usual, when suddenly the song ceased, his anger
was too much for him, and he almost hissed forth
the words, “I’ll eat him up blood raw widout a
bit o’ salt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor, ignorant, black Dan’s roaming about
town and card-playing were suddenly cut short.
He was attacked with inflammatory rheumatism,
and lay helpless and suffering on a cot in our room
many days and nights, my dear, patient mother
caring for him as best she could, until so worn out
that she was compelled to have him removed to the
negro quarters. His groans were piteous to hear,
and sleep was almost unknown while he remained
in our room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>CLOSING INCIDENTS AND HOMEWARD BOUND</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>FAREWELL to Jackson, sunny Jackson—that is
it was sunny when the sun shone, but as dark
and dreary as can be imagined when it rained—the
very name is dear to me yet, and the memories that
cluster around it are dearer still. When I review
my four months’ experience in the Sunny South I
feel that the memory of it is something to be proud
of. I saw no fighting, but there were skirmishes
all around us, and many prisoners were brought in.
Some of the saddest sights I saw were prisoners
being marched through the streets in the rain,
wading through the mud, the water dripping from
their faded butternut suits. Many days we heard
heavy cannonading which indicated that battles
were being fought in close proximity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time came when we must return to our
home in the North. My father having recovered
sufficiently to rejoin his regiment at Bolivar, left
some days before we did. On the last Sunday of
our stay a young soldier by the name of Frank
Moss, whose home was in Aberdeen, Ohio, whither
we were going, called on my mother and sent
messages of love by her to his mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning in February we bade farewell to
the scenes that had become so dear to us, and turned
our faces homeward. On the train with us was a
wounded officer. His hurt was in the leg, and he
was on a cot in one corner of the car. His wound
was very painful, and as the train jolted he seemed
to suffer much and was very cross and irritable.
His wife was with him. When we reached the
bridge which had been burned a few weeks before,
we had to stop and transfer mail and passengers.
We crossed the Obion on the ties of the new and
unfinished bridge. A soldier carried me, another
carried “Little Rosebud,” while still another led
my mother. The bridge was very high, and they
told us the water was many feet deep at this point.
A few days previous the man who led my mother
had told a lady while crossing, just how deep it
was (eighty feet) and she became so faint and
frightened at the knowledge, that he found it almost
impossible to convey her safely over. While
crossing I asked the man who carried me, in a whisper,
how much he thought I weighed. “Oh, about
a ton,” was his laughing reply, and the next time
I spoke after clearing the bridge, my voice had
returned and I spoke aloud for the first time since
my recovery from the measles.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we arrived at Columbus we found there
would be no boat until the next day. We remained
all night at the hotel, trying in vain to sleep on a
hard, relentless bed. The boat came in next day,
but the wind was blowing a gale, and the Captain
refused to go further. The boat was a small, box-like
affair, called the Rob Roy, top-heavy and in
danger of capsizing in a high wind. All day we
remained at the hotel, and all day the boat remained
tied up at the landing. I read Ruth Hall within
while the wind raged without, and the huge
waves washed the shore. At nightfall the captain
sent word to the hotel for the passengers to come
on board, and should the wind lull through the
night, he would start. But the wind didn’t lull,
and we remained tied up all night.</p>

<p class='c000'>I lay on a narrow wooden bench with our carpet
bag for a pillow, while my poor, tired mother
passed another sleepless night sitting on a hard,
uncomfortable chair, with the baby in her arms.
All the large boats had gone north, and the Rob
Roy was the only one plying between Columbus
and Cairo. It had no conveniences whatever, neither
ladies’ cabin nor staterooms, and no facilities
for cooking and eating. How well I remember
that comfortless night, how one of the boat’s crew
dropped a heavy wooden bucket of water on the
bare floor, making a terrific crash. I thought the
boiler had burst, and we were on our way to the
bottom. Then anon, the blaze of the lamp, hung
high on the side of the little square cabin, shot out
at the top of the dingy chimney, and I sat up on
my bench bed and screamed out, “Take it down,
take it down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Morning dawned at last, calm and clear, and
we were soon plowing the yellow Mississippi,
with the dark Missouri forests on our right. As
we neared Cairo my mother called me on deck to
view the “meeting of the waters.” To me, as I
recall it now, it resembled a bias seam running
across from shore to shore. At Cairo my mother
debated long whether to continue the homeward
journey by river or rail, having a presentiment of
an accident in either case, but finally decided in
favor of the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had nothing to eat since our lunch on the
Rob Roy, brought from the hotel, until we reached
Centralia, Ill. Just after nightfall the train stopped
in front of an eating house, my mother called for
coffee and lunch, which were handed through the
car window. We ate and drank hurriedly, and even
then the train was moving as the empty dishes were
handed back to the waiter, and we settled down for
a night’s steady traveling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Throughout this journey there had always been
some one to arrange a seat for my comfort, and
this part of it was no exception to the rule. I was
soon sound asleep and knew no more until rudely
awakened by a loud crash, and by being thrown
violently to the floor. My mother was thrown forward
on her knees, while the baby struck the seat
in front. The accident had happened. Consternation
and excitement prevailed, but it was soon
learned that the track had been torn up and our
train wrecked. It was 4 o’clock in the morning,
but was yet quite dark. Examination by the light
of lanterns showed that the engine, baggage, mail
and express cars had plunged down an embankment
40 feet deep. Our car became uncoupled from the
one in front, which was all that saved it from a like
fate. Even then it was so tilted toward the edge
of the precipice that it was with difficulty we could
get out.</p>

<p class='c000'>We sat on a log and waited for dawn and the
righting up of our car. The engine caught fire
and burned up. The engineer was killed outright,
and the fireman so badly hurt that he died a few
days later. “Little Rosebud” came home with
blood on her dress that dripped from his wounds as
he was carried through our car. We were in Indiana
when the accident happened, and it was supposed
to have been the work of “copperheads” or
rebel sympathizers. We were about seventy-five
miles from Cincinnati, and four miles from the
nearest station, to which the conductor walked and
telegraphed to the city for help. We sat for hours
in the coach with nothing to eat. The train men,
with bandaged heads, and arms in slings, passed in
and out rehearsing the accident and trying to cheer
us as best they could. Late in the afternoon an engine
came out from the city, and we were soon
speeding along, getting hungrier each mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a gentleman on the train who was
very kind to us. He, too, had been south, speculating
in cotton and was now returning to his family
in Cincinnati. He tried at every station where we
stopped to get something for us to eat, but strangely
enough, nothing could be obtained, not even a
cup of coffee, which my mother so much needed,
she being nearly exhausted from loss of sleep and
lack of food. The gentleman at last secured some
small cakes of maple sugar, some of which he gave
to me, keeping the others for his two little girls,
whose home, he said, was at the Burnett House,
and who had never even heard of maple sugar. He
laughingly told me to read the signs on the restaurants
as we passed, and try to think I was having
something good to eat.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we rolled into the great city, the lights
were gleaming everywhere, and the newsboys were
crying the accident on the streets. We went immediately
to the Henrie House. It was Saturday
evening, and we feared we would have to stay until
Monday, but were informed by the clerk that the
steamer Marmora would start in a very few moments.
There was no time for supper, and we
hurried down to the boat. A lunch was hastily
prepared for us, of which we partook sparingly,
and at the regular supper we did ample justice to
the meal. We traveled all night without knowing
it, so soundly did we sleep, and on Sunday morning,
February 22, 1863, we walked up the snow-clad
banks of the Ohio, shivering with the cold, and
wishing ourselves back in the sunny clime of the
beautiful Southland.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c007'>YEARS after these events, when white-winged
peace hovered o’er all the land, while conning
my geography lesson at school, and trying to fix in
my mind that the city of Constantinople is situated
on the Sea of Marmora, that night of hunger came
back to me vividly, and the stern-wheel steamer
Marmora, with her lights reflected in the broad
bosom of the Ohio, loomed up before me with a reality
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dear mother who made that long, and in
those days perilous, journey, with the care of two
little children, has gone to her reward, borne to her
last resting place by six honored and respected
soldiers of the community. The father for whose
sake the journey was made still lingers on the
shores of Time. “Little Rosebud,” the pet of the
hospital, is a happy wife and mother, while the
writer fills an humble sphere at home, and writes
her name today just as she did thirty-seven years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>My little story is done. It is but a faint and
feeble outline of those far off-days, and but a slender
thread that connects me with The Great Rebellion.
But such as it is, I dedicate it to the G. A. R.
in general and the “boys” of Corinth in particular,
and to my dear sister who as an infant in arms,
could know nothing of this period in her life and
mine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boys who wore the blue, you have long been
gray. Many of your ranks have already “crossed
the river, and are resting under the trees,” not in
wall tents or Sibleys, but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In those low green tents</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose curtain never outward swings.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And when for them and you the “long roll” is
sounded, commanding all the vast armies to “turn
out” and “fall in” for the last Grand Review, and
you stand in serried ranks before the Great Commander,
Oh! may you all be able to sing as in one
grand chorus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Just as I am, without one plea,</div>
      <div class='line'>But that Thy blood was shed for me</div>
      <div class='line'>And that Thou bidds’t me come to Thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! Lamb of God! I come, I come.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>Nathan W. Crooks, prominently identified
with the early portion of this history, died at
Washington C. H., O., on May 6, 1900.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wesley Jackman, one of the four hungry “boys
from home” whom I fed at the Manassas House,
Jackson, answered the final call on August 6, 1901,
just three days before the last pages of this book
went to press.</p>
